    "# Building a Simple Text Classifier in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "Having explored the foundational concepts of converting text from human language into machine-friendly tensors, you are now ready to apply that knowledge to a practical challenge. You have seen how raw text is tokenized, transformed into numerical IDs, and then represented by meaningful vectors called embeddings that capture semantic relationships between words. This lab will guide you through the process of building a complete text classification pipeline from scratch using PyTorch. The goal is to train a model that can read the title of a recipe and classify it as either fruit-based or vegetable-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on lab will solidify your understanding of the entire workflow, from initial data preparation to final model evaluation. You will put theory into practice and tackle common challenges in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this lab, you'll learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prepare and preprocess raw text data**, which includes cleaning, tokenizing, and building a vocabulary from a training dataset to avoid data leakage.\n",
    "* **Construct custom PyTorch `Dataset` and `DataLoader` objects** and implement custom `collate` functions to efficiently handle batches of variable-length text sequences.\n",
    "* **Build, train, and compare multiple model architectures**. This includes an efficient model using `nn.EmbeddingBag` and others that perform manual pooling operations like mean, max, and sum.\n",
    "* **Address a class imbalance problem** in the dataset by applying class weights to the loss function, a vital technique for training fair and accurate models on skewed data.\n",
    "* **Evaluate your trained models** to select the best-performing one based on the F1 score and then test its predictive power on new, unseen recipe titles."

    "## The Recipe Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, you will work with a specially prepared dataset derived from a large collection of recipes. You will load the prepared dataset and get it ready for the modeling process. This involves transforming the recipe titles and labels into a numerical format that a PyTorch model can understand.\n",

    "Your data originates from the [Food.com Recipes and User Interactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions) dataset, a vast collection of over 230,000 recipes gathered over 18 years. This rich dataset contains everything from recipe names and ingredients to cooking steps and nutritional information. For the purposes of this lab, a subset of this data has been pre-created, focusing solely on recipes that are either fruit-based or vegetable-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Subset Was Created**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `recipes_fruit_veg.csv` file you'll use was generated by a script that filtered the original dataset. In short, the script performed the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It scanned each recipe’s ingredients for a predefined list of common fruit and vegetable keywords.\n",
    "* To create distinct categories, it only kept recipes that contained fruit keywords but no vegetable keywords, or vice versa.\n",
    "* Any recipe that contained a mix of both categories, or neither, was excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensures the dataset has two mutually exclusive classes, which is ideal for this classification task. If you're interested, you can explore the exact logic in the `filter_recipe_dataset` function within the `helper_utils.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, run the cell below to load the dataset. This will read the data from the `recipes_fruit_veg.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame called `df`."

    "\n",
    "In all of your previous modules on computer vision, you saw that every image was preprocessed into a **fixed**, **uniform size** (e.g., 224x224 pixels). Since each image tensor had the exact same dimensions, the `DataLoader` could easily combine them into a single batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text, however, is naturally variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"apple pie\"` becomes a tensor of length 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"roasted broccoli and garlic\"` becomes a tensor of length 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you'll run into an issue with the `DataLoader`'s **default configuration**. By default, it tries to create a batch by stacking the individual tensors. This operation will fail because your text tensors have different lengths, and they can't be stacked into a single, uniform tensor. This is the new challenge you must solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: The `collate_fn` Parameter**\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, you'll use an optional but powerful parameter of the `DataLoader` class: `collate_fn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This parameter lets you provide your own custom function that defines exactly how to take a list of samples from your `Dataset` and combine them into a single batch. Instead of using the default behavior, the `DataLoader` will execute your custom logic.\n",

    "          )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You are essentially telling the `DataLoader`, \"Don't use your default stacking method; use my specific instructions to form a batch.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice of using a `collate_fn` is also the standard and most efficient method. While you could pad all sentences from the start, that approach is inefficient, leading to **significant memory and computational waste**. By using a `collate_fn` to perform \"dynamic padding,\" each batch is only padded to the length of the longest sentence within that batch, which saves resources and speeds up training.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will define two such functions, one for each of the model architectures that will be covered in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, define `collate_batch_embeddingbag`, which takes a list of samples and prepares a batch specifically formatted for PyTorch's efficient `nn.EmbeddingBag` layer (this will be covered in the next section).\n",
    "    * It first extracts all the labels and text tensors from the batch.\n",
    "    * It then creates a single, long 1D tensor, `flattened_text`, by concatenating all the individual text tensors together.\n",

By assigning a higher weight to the 'fruit' class, you tell the loss function to penalize the model more heavily for making mistakes on fruit recipes. This forces the model to pay closer attention to the minority class, leading to a more balanced and fair classifier.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this lab! You have successfully navigated the entire pipeline for building a text classifier in PyTorch, moving from raw, unstructured text to a functional predictive model. This lab demonstrated how to translate the core concepts of text representation into a real-world application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You began by carefully preprocessing the recipe data, building a vocabulary, and preparing `DataLoaders` that can handle the variable nature of text data, a key difference from working with fixed-size images. You implemented two distinct but related model architectures: one using the highly optimized `nn.EmbeddingBag` and another that allowed for manual control over different pooling strategies (`mean`, `max`, and `sum`). This comparison gave you direct insight into how different aggregation methods can impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you tackled the very common challenge of class imbalance by calculating and applying class weights, ensuring your model learned to classify both fruit and vegetable recipes effectively, rather than being biased toward the majority class. Finally, you systematically evaluated your models using the F1 score to identify the top performer and tested it on new, unseen data, which is the ultimate measure of a model's ability to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model you built serves as an excellent baseline. The embeddings were trained from scratch on your specific dataset. The next logical step, which builds directly on these skills, is to leverage the power of **pre-trained embeddings**. Using vectors from models like GloVe or BERT, which have been trained on billions of words, can provide your model with a much richer understanding of language from the very start, often leading to significant performance gains."
